## Open World Village Building RPG

Skills like Fishing, Woodcutting, Farming and Mining etc. which are used to make better tools, make combat gear(?) and build the village as well as to do quests in the village. To get better resources you travel to new islands where the next resource is located, or you travel to a procedurally generated land where the further away from “spawn” you get the better resources you find, these resources can be refined to be used in crafting and building.
